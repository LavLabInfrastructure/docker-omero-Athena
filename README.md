# docker-omero-Athena !WIP!
## see ORIGINAL_README for general info
### Changes from default websocket OME:
### Uses custom server dockerfile
See [docker-omero-serverLLAB](https://github.com/barrettMCW/docker-omero-serverLLAB/)
### Implements HistoQC processing
See [OIP-LLAB](https://github.com/barrettMCW/OIP-llab)
After being processed through the pipeline a score is calculated and products are imported to omero through DropBox
### Production SSL
As far as I'm aware everything is SSL encrypted
Autogenerated certificates are off and self-generated certificates are disabled
### Config file templates
Has nearly all config settings commented out in .template.ymls
HIGHLY recommend you copy it, remove .template and configure your instance through those
### Redis cache
I've never used this before and tbh I can't tell if it's working but ther's no errors, and I triple checked the installation documentation so good enough I guess
