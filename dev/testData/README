Bioformat images added before the first boot will be imported, images added while the server is running will be imported.
BUT PICTURES ADDED AFTER INITIALIZATION AND WHILE THE SERVER IS OFF WILL NOT BE IMPORTED!
Add the pictures while it is running, delete the OMERO.server volume and reinitialize the server, or manually import them after boot.
